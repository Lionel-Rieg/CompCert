(** Schedule instructions on a synchronized pipeline
by David Monniaux, CNRS, VERIMAG *)

(** A latency constraint: instruction number [instr_to] should be scheduled at least [latency] clock ticks before [instr_from].

It is possible to specify [latency]=0, meaning that [instr_to] can be scheduled at the same clock tick as [instr_from], but not before.

[instr_to] can be the special value equal to the number of instructions, meaning that it refers to the final output latency. *)

In addition to the latency constraints, the resource constraints should be satisfied: at every clock tick, the sum of vectors of resources used by the instructions scheduled at that tick does not exceed the resource bounds.
